### Project Description
This student grade calculator project, implemented in JavaScript, calculates a student's performance based on their scores in five subjects and their attendance percentage. The user inputs scores for Distributed Computing, Internet of Things, Data Mining, Network Security Protocols, and an additional subject, along with their attendance percentage. The script validates the attendance, ensuring it's between 0 and 100. It then calculates the total score out of 750 and the corresponding percentage. Based on the percentage, the student is assigned a grade of `S`, `A+`, `B+`, or `F`. If the attendance is below 75%, the calculator displays a warning, indicating that low attendance may affect the final result. The pass or fail status depends on achieving a minimum percentage of 39.5% and maintaining at least 75% attendance. The final output includes the student's total score, percentage, grade, and attendance status. This project effectively combines academic performance and attendance to provide a comprehensive evaluation of student progress.

### The Problem statement
The problem is to create a student grading system that calculates a student's total score and percentage based on their performance in five subjects and their attendance percentage. The system needs to assign a grade according to the percentage and also check if the student's attendance meets a minimum requirement of 75%. If the attendance is too low, a warning should be displayed. The final result should indicate whether the student has passed or failed, considering both their grades and attendance. The goal is to provide a complete evaluation of the student's performance, combining academic scores and class participation.

### The Solution
The student grading system calculates the total score and percentage based on five subject marks and assigns a grade accordingly. It also checks if the student's attendance meets the 75% requirement. If attendance is low, a warning is issued. The final result considers both grades and attendance, determining whether the student passes or fails, ensuring a complete evaluation of academic performance and class participation.
